This project presents a comprehensive Excel analytics solution built to explore and visualize global sales trends for fruits and vegetables in 2016. It includes automated pivot tables, interactive slicers, custom formatting, and a professionally designed dashboard that highlights key insights by product, category, country, and monthly trends.

**Project Overview**
