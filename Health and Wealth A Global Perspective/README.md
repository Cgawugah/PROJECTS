**Overview**

This project delivers a deep analytical exploration of global life expectancy by examining the health, economic, lifestyle, and immunization factors that shape population well being.
Using a large dataset with more than 2900 rows across multiple countries and years, this Power BI dashboard uncovers patterns and relationships that influence how long people live and why health outcomes differ across regions.

Even though the dataset is extensive, the report is structured into clear thematic pages that make the insights easy to understand and navigate. The richness of the dataset allows meaningful trends to emerge and provides strong analytical grounding.

This project is especially important to me because it combines technical analysis with topics that affect real lives on a global scale.

**Dataset**

The dataset includes more than 2930 records with yearly measurements for countries worldwide.
Key fields include:

Life expectancy

Adult mortality

Infant deaths

Alcohol consumption

BMI

GDP

Total health expenditure

Under five deaths

Immunization rates for Polio, Diphtheria, Hepatitis B, and Measles

HIV AIDS prevalence

Income composition of resources

Development status (Developing or Developed)

The large size of the dataset enhances reliability and allows complex relationships to be analyzed across different socioeconomic and health conditions.

**Project Structure**

To ensure clarity and depth, the Power BI report is organized into five analytical pages:

**1. Health Report**

Examines mortality trends, HIV AIDS prevalence, under five deaths, and total health expenditure across countries.
Provides a clear view of global health outcomes and disparities.

**2. Economic Report**

Analyzes GDP, income composition of resources, and their correlation with life expectancy.
Highlights how economic strength contributes to improved health outcomes.

**3. Lifestyle Report**

Focuses on alcohol consumption, BMI patterns, and lifestyle related influences on life expectancy.
Helps identify how societal habits impact population health.

**4. Immunization Report**

Studies how vaccination rates for Polio, Measles, Hepatitis B, and Diphtheria affect life expectancy.
Illustrates the power of preventive care in improving long term outcomes.

**5. Global Overview Dashboard**

A consolidated page that brings together metrics and visuals from all other sections.
Allows quick comparison of health, economic, and lifestyle factors across countries.

**Key Insights**

Life expectancy has steadily increased across most countries, especially from the early 2000s onward.

Higher GDP and stronger income structures are positively correlated with longer life expectancy.

Developed countries consistently show better health outcomes and lower infant and adult mortality.

Immunization coverage strongly aligns with improved life expectancy and reduced disease burden.

Lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption and BMI show measurable effects depending on development status.

**Tools and Skills Demonstrated**

Power BI Desktop

Data modeling

DAX for calculations and measures

Data transformation and cleaning

Time series analysis

Correlation and trend analysis

Dashboard design and layout planning

Cross domain analysis combining health, economics, and lifestyle data

**Why This Project Matters**

This report goes beyond simple visualization. It tells a coherent story about health and longevity using real global data.
The combination of health metrics, economic indicators, lifestyle factors, and immunization statistics allows for a holistic understanding of global well being.
The multi page design ensures clarity, depth, and strong professional presentation, making the project valuable for analysis, discussion, and decision making.
