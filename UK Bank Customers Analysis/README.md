**UK Bank Customers Analysis**

This project delivers a comprehensive analysis of UK bank customers using Power BI. The dashboard reveals customer characteristics, financial patterns, demographic trends, and regional performance based on a dataset of more than four thousand customers.

The objective is to uncover insights that can support data driven decision making in areas such as customer segmentation, product targeting, marketing strategy, and regional performance evaluation.

**Project Overview**

The report explores and visualises key indicators including:

Total account balance distribution

Customer demographics across age, gender, job classification and region

Customer count and balance patterns segmented by age groups

Comparative analysis of male and female customers

Customer representation by job type including white collar, blue collar and other classifications

Regional distribution of customer balances across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland

Each visual is designed to provide actionable insights at a glance, supported by an interactive dashboard for deeper analysis.

**Key Insights**
**Demographic Trends**

Customers are distributed across multiple age categories, with clear differences in balance volumes and customer counts among age groups. Gender comparisons reveal close representation with slight variations in total balances.

**Job Classification Insights**

White collar customers represent the largest share, followed by blue collar and other categories. Job classification plays a notable role in both customer count and balance distribution.

**Regional Performance**

England maintains the highest share of total customer balances, followed by Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Regional insight helps illustrate geographic financial strength and customer composition.
