# SaaS Performance Analytics Dashboard  
Power BI Project

This project presents a Power BI dashboard that analyzes key SaaS business metrics including customer lifetime value, acquisition cost, churn rate, active users, new users, marketing spend and recurring revenue.  
The dataset used for this report is intentionally small and simplified. This makes it ideal for rapid prototyping, demonstrating KPI logic and showcasing how core SaaS metrics can be modeled and visualized without requiring a large volume of data.

## Project Overview

The goal of this dashboard is to highlight essential SaaS performance indicators across a twelve month period.  
The report focuses on understanding how customer behavior, revenue and marketing investment change over time, and how these factors influence long term SaaS growth.

Despite the small dataset, the dashboard effectively demonstrates how SaaS businesses track retention, user activity, profitability and marketing effectiveness.

## Dataset

Table used  
Calculated Data  

This table contains monthly values for  
Month  
New users  
Lost users  
Active users  
Revenue  
Daily active users (DAU)  
Monthly active users (MAU)  
Marketing spend  
Churn rate  
Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)  
Customer lifetime value (LTV)  

The dataset is concise, with one row per month. This structure allows clear month to month trend evaluation and serves as a clean example for understanding SaaS metric behavior.

**Business Questions Answered**
Why are users churning?
What is our Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)?
What’s our Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)?
How sticky is the product (DAU/MAU ratio)?
What is our monthly churn rate?
How efficient is our marketing spend (CAC)?
Are we growing sustainably?

## Dashboard Features and Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators  
Average LTV  
Average CAC  
Average DAU to MAU ratio (stickiness)  

### User and Retention Metrics  
Active users by month  
Churn rate by month  
New users versus marketing spend  

### Revenue Metrics  
MRR by month  
Total revenue pattern over twelve months  

These metrics allow quick assessment of acquisition efficiency, retention strength and revenue stability.


## Key Insights

User activity and MRR show a gradual decline toward the end of the year  
Churn rate fluctuates but shows improvement in later months  
Marketing spend does not always correlate directly with new user growth  
LTV increases over time, indicating improving customer value  

These findings help illustrate how SaaS companies evaluate performance even within simple datasets.

## Tools and Techniques Used

Power BI Desktop  
DAX for calculated measures  
Line charts, bar charts and KPI visuals  
Simple data modeling using a single clean table

## Summary

This dashboard demonstrates how meaningful SaaS performance insights can be generated even from a compact dataset.  
By focusing on key recurring revenue metrics, user activity and churn behavior, the report provides a clear representation of how SaaS KPIs are monitored and interpreted.  
The project illustrates the ability to design clean, focused dashboards that communicate essential business performance with clarity.
